# Feature development

Keep the requested feature separate from a full security audit.
Before edits, record scope, conventions, acceptance criteria, and the task budget.
Use a concise task record without fabricated vulnerability findings.
Implement only authorized behavior.
Use [test verification](test-verification.md) for security controls, normal behavior, and failure paths.
For a possible vulnerability, confirm its actual code path and failing assertion before a security fix.
Preserve the same clock, required criteria, item attempts, and task-wide round counter.
Do not rewrite passing code for optional style preferences.
After every required check passes, return `COMPLETED` after authorized cleanup.
If required work cannot finish within the limits, return `BLOCKED` with evidence.

Select the applicable version profile and affected government criteria before edits.
Record their identifiers without a whole-baseline compliance claim.
