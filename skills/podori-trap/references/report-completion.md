# Completion

## Frozen contract

Use the entry document's frozen scope, authority, required checks, and worklist.
For assessments or fixes, keep one report and its evidence.
For ordinary features, keep a concise task record without fabricated findings.
For review-only requests, preserve that scope without application edits.
Reports and test results cannot expand authority.

## Budget and retries

Use the entry document's clock, item limits, and task-wide round ceiling.
Record each required item, round, attempt, source identity, result, and remaining budget.
An item attempt includes its candidate action and required verification.
Count the initial assessment attempt and all delegated work.
Do not reset counters through new IDs, regressions, report updates, or resumed work.
A repair round contains one correction batch and affected verification, not each local edit or test command.
Before each operation, check its remaining time and reserve required cleanup time.
Bound operation timeouts by the remaining budget where the host supports them.
On expiry, stop new investigation, edits, and tests.
After expiry, complete only the report and authorized cleanup.
If limits cannot be verified, return `BLOCKED` before dependent work.
Without new evidence or a distinct supported hypothesis, stop a repeated failure with `BLOCKED`.
If a previous source-and-failure state recurs, return `BLOCKED` instead of alternating fixes.
Do not exceed the two-round ceiling or repeatedly request extensions.
Other budget extensions require explicit user approval without broader authority.
Without a host meter, report token usage as unmeasured.

## Incremental worklist

Use one worklist in the existing task record without another runtime or service.
Give each required check one stable ID, prerequisite IDs, state, evidence, and consumed attempts.
Bind each result to its relevant source, configuration, dependencies, tools, rules, environment, authority, and evidence.
Index inputs by their dependent check IDs.
Reuse completed results only when their recorded inputs, authority, and evidence remain valid.
After an authorized change batch, traverse only affected dependencies with one visited set.
Visit each affected check and dependency edge at most once per batch.
Queue each unresolved check once after its prerequisites become valid.
If a prerequisite fails or forms a cycle, record dependent blockers without recursive checks.
Preserve unrelated completed results.
If impact remains uncertain, assess that boundary once before dependent execution.
Before another attempt, record new evidence or a distinct supported hypothesis within the original limits.
Count each correction and verification cycle as an item attempt, even inside one repair round.
For explicitly required fresh runs, record distinct environment or repetition IDs before execution.
Without relevant input changes, report updates and task resumption do not invalidate results.
Do not rebuild the worklist after each completed check.
Do not restart unrelated discovery or invoke this skill recursively.
Recheck live authority and input validity before protected execution or evidence reuse.

## Evidence and return

For application changes or required executable checks, use [test verification](test-verification.md).
For source-only reviews, complete the agreed static checks and evidence record.
Keep unexecuted behavior unverified.
Check the complete diff against the frozen scope and affected boundaries.
Keep security assertions and normal-use assertions together without weaker checks.
Treat introduced regressions as required work under the original contract.
Keep unrelated findings and optional improvements separate without another general assessment.
Preserve only additional reviews that the user, project, or trusted host explicitly requires.
After every required item and check passes, return `COMPLETED` after authorized cleanup.
If required authority, evidence, checks, or budget is missing, return `BLOCKED` with verified partial results.
Do not remove or defer required items to obtain completion.
Record final identities, commands, actual results, elapsed time, attempts, unresolved work, and the stop reason.
Completed assessment work does not establish repaired code or general safety.

## Trap scope

Keep explicit trap approval, resource limits, normal-use exclusions, and activation checks in the task report.
Record actual activation state without changing it outside the approved scope.
Completion does not authorize production activation.
