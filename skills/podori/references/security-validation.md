# Security Validation

## Report and conventions

For security assessments or confirmed fixes, create one current [report](../templates/security-report.md) and [convention baseline](../templates/project-conventions.md).
For ordinary feature work, use a concise task record with scope, conventions, security criteria, normal-use criteria, and required checks.
Create the applicable record before application edits.
Do not fabricate vulnerability findings for feature work.
Use the project review location or host task-artifact area.
Keep records outside application source unless the project specifies otherwise.
Scale records to scope.
For security assessments or confirmed fixes, populate the templates with source, relevant uncommitted evidence, and record revisions.
Separate source-supported candidates, proposed work, and executed test results.
Only authorized feature work and evidence-confirmed vulnerability fixes enter executable work.
Reports grant no execution or change authority.
Block approval/evidence-dependent items without blocking unrelated authorized work.
Before each change, compare current source and assumptions against the applicable records.
Revalidate affected required items only when their source, assumptions, or evidence materially change.
Update actual changes, results, exceptions, and unresolved checks in the same records.
Preserve resolved items' original evidence.

Derive conventions from applicable instructions, approved documentation, tool configuration, and representative nearby code before edits.
Distinguish explicit requirements, observed patterns, and unresolved conflicts.
Cite files/configuration for every convention.
Cover affected naming, module boundaries, dependencies, errors, logging, tests, formatting, lint, and types.
Use configured tools/commands, not invented rules or personal preferences.
Resolve conflicts before dependent changes.
For vulnerable conventions, propose safe exceptions with report-linked reason, scope, and required approval.
Apply exceptions only within existing authority.
Exclude unrelated style changes and repository-wide formatting.

## Coverage

For security assessments, populate report coverage for every material attack path within the frozen scope.
Use `open`, `reviewed`, `deferred`, or `out_of_scope`.
Require source traces and control checks for `reviewed`, even with unresolved defects.
Record reasons and next checks for deferred/excluded paths.
Compare reused records with current source and assumptions.
Reopen changed paths and unresolved checks.
Empty results or incomplete coverage do not prove safety.

## Finding evidence

Use [test verification](test-verification.md) as the default verification procedure.
Trace reachability, existing controls, prerequisites, and impact through actual source and configuration.
For behavioral defects, require a failing assertion against the real target code before confirmation.
For static controls, use the applicable configured check and record its limited verification scope.
Keep claims unresolved when available checks cannot establish the claimed behavior.

| Verdict | Requirement |
|---|---|
| `confirmed` | Source evidence and an applicable executed check establish the violation, prerequisites, and supported impact. |
| `needs_validation` | Record the missing premise, check, or evidence without a local severity rating. |
| `rejected` | Evidence establishes a failed premise or an effective preventive control. |

A passing test does not reject a claim outside that test's coverage.
Keep runtime claims unverified without runtime evidence.
Deduplicate candidates by root cause and boundary.

## Severity and work order

Classify confirmed vulnerabilities with CVSS v4.0.
Use CVSS-B for new local assessments.
Record the version, nomenclature, vector, metric evidence, score source, and assessment date.
Use approved local score records or an available, verified calculator.
Do not estimate scores or install calculators during review.
Accept scores from 0.0 through 10.0 with one decimal place.
For unsupported scores or unconfirmed candidates, record `unrated` without a local score or CVSS rating.
`unrated` is an assessment state, not a CVSS rating.

| Severity | CVSS score |
|---|---|
| `critical` | 9.0-10.0 |
| `high` | 7.0-8.9 |
| `medium` | 4.0-6.9 |
| `low` | 0.1-3.9 |
| `none` | 0.0 |

Preserve published advisory scores separately with their original versions, vectors, sources, and applicability evidence.
Do not relabel another CVSS version as v4.0.
Before the worklist freeze, use severity to propose scope and order, not automatic exclusions.
Within authorized work, address critical, high, medium, then low items.
Record exposure, business impact, or dependency constraints for priority overrides.
Review unrated items by documented impact and evidence gaps, never as automatically low priority.
A lower severity does not remove frozen required items.
Severity grants no authority, budget extension, or general safety verdict.

Optional provenance: [FIRST CVSS v4.0, qualitative severity scale](https://www.first.org/cvss/v4.0/specification-document#Qualitative-Severity-Rating-Scale).
Do not fetch the source during review.

## Safe execution

Inspect relevant commands, hooks, and dependencies before execution.
Execute unfamiliar target code only in an approved disposable OS-level sandbox.
Exclude host credentials, production data, privileges, and unrelated host mounts.
Disable external network unless the user explicitly approves its scope.
Bound CPU, memory, storage, and runtime.
Use synthetic data and controlled test services.
Do not download or execute malware.
Without required isolation, continue static review without runtime claims.

## Feature verification

For ordinary feature changes, verify affected security controls, normal-use behavior, failure paths, and configured quality checks.
Record actual evidence and unresolved required checks in the task record.
Do not require a separate vulnerability report or full audit without a security finding or explicit audit scope.

## Fix verification

For confirmed fixes, preserve the pre-fix failure and post-fix success of the same required assertions.
Require security and normal-behavior evidence from actual project tests.
Check the complete diff against the frozen scope, conventions, and affected boundaries.
Separate pre-existing failures from introduced regressions.
Record source identities, commands, exit status, reports, and unresolved checks without secrets.
Without safe execution or required evidence, leave the dependent fix unverified.
Complete the report under the [completion contract](report-completion.md).
